<h3>
Teach your kids the hard lessons in life with, Alan. Alan Baldloss.
</h3>
<h4>Description/Features</h4>
<h4><strong>--WARNING--</strong></h4>

<p>
Best for extremely religious families. Those that prefer the belt, or the chancla - over discussion and understanding. Alan does'nt care if your child is 12. He WILL curse them to hell. Teach your kids the mental gymnastics it takes to maneuver around the erratic feelings of a manipulative adult man. This is the model i had growing up. I would not reccomend Alan to most people. this model has been discounted <strong>75% OFF!</strong> due to constant customer complaints and returns. We have a warehouse full of them. 
Bonus? comes with alot of money. Is hardly home so the harassment is not a daily occurence. Does not have a forklift certification - but can easily hire a forklift operator. 
If you would like a double, I reccomed getting a more calm and kind model along with the Alan. If Alan feels his power over the family is threatened he will have a meltdown and you must send him back to the factory for a reset. first full year of re-sets are free. Because he is heavily discounted - You only have 6 months maximum to be able to return for a full refund.

<h3>
DeVonte 3.0
</h3>
<h4>Description/Features</h4>
<p>
Number 1 customer favorite. DeVonte is a master cook, indoors and out.<br> will actually clean the house if its dirty<br> (If you have an unclean home DeVonte will be come flustered, <br>and if you dont clean or allow him to help he may walk around mumbling for hours -<br> somehow stretching a single beer out to last the entire time /<br> or he may leave to hang out with another local dad.).<br> He always makes time for the kids and is able to be home often <br> he owns his own online business.<br> Comes in various versions, <br>many different religions for religious folks and an agnostic and atheist version as well.<br> Comes with various political options. DeVonte also has a unique setting, our trademark LOUDdadLAUGH siren in case you, or him gets lost. The second he loses sight of you or the kids youll get a warning notification on your phone - letting you know the alarm will sound in 30 seconds unless silenced. A gentle parent - one who will pull your kids aside for a 4 hour talk (no breaks) as punishment. if eye contact is broken the punishment will re-start. DeVonte will not be sure if the child is absorbing the information until they can tell him why they think they were wrong. Helps children  increase understanding and attention span. several different backstories available for this model.

<h3>
Slim+Sensitive : Brody modelA and modelB
</h3>
<h4>Description/Features</h4>
<p>
Another famous replica, this time a customer favorite. Enjoy the spoils of this wealthy handsome man. He is also very kind. Though not able to be home as much as DeVonte because of his career. But still - a great man nonetheless. ModelA is a gentle, sensitive man. Able to clearly express his feelings without shame, does not hold things in and is not prone to angry outbursts. A very happy man. And again.. Obviously - very beautiful which is an important feature for some that do not intend on having a "real" relationship with the dad. ModelB is a bit younger than the modelA and a bit spicy. Maybe not quite ripe enough to be a perfect dad like the modelA - but alot of fun. The modelB is a bit of a menace. Has alot more money. He spends most of his time trying to steal an expensive painting from a friend of his deceased relative. The idea of it consumes him. Much less time for and interest in fatherhood UNLESS you help him aquire the painting. If you have the time to hunt some one down, and kill/steal from them this is a great option. Best option for those with partial custody.

<h3>
SpoonMan Elchiyev
</h3>
<h4>Description/Features</h4>
<p>
A quiet, contemplative, yet talented dad - Elchiyev can teach your children so much about patience while they help him aquire and attach his spoons. Comes with a set of 10 spoons - but he will collect more daily until his body is covered. Lock up and hide any spoons that you do not want taken. You can borrow his spoons when needed but he will want them back immediately after use. Elchiyev is gentle, and prefers spoon related discipline when kids need a lesson. His go to punishment is spoon searching, washing/polishing and re-attachment. He works as an online influencer and can stay at home whenever you need. The more spoons you help him find - the richer he becomes. If you help him aquire the guiness world record he will stop trying to collect and have more time for hugs. He is known for his dry sense of humor. A great choice for those that want to teach their kids how to be gentle, thoughtful, creative, devoted people with strong backbones that dont worry what others think about their alternative careers.

<h2 id="vintage">Famous Clones / Reproductions of vintage models</h2>

<h3>
Matthew Lillard (90's)
</h3>
<h4>Description/Features</h4>
<p>
Comes with all peircings and jewelery seen in photos (and the belly button apartment key chain which is not visible here) 
Great Silly personality, this model is more for the parent than the child. A bit young to be a perfect dad, but definetly cares alot and your children will have a fun time hanging out with him. They will see him as more of a cool older cousin/uncle. Tired of boring days? Go on a wacky adventure with lillard and then have him babysit when its time to go back to work.

<h3>
Stokely Charmichael (Kwame Ture)
</h3>
<h4>Description/Features</h4>
<p>
Best for left-leaning families. Extremely intelligent - the type that would never punish a child. Instead - he is a big fan of the long talks and explanations. Great teacher of U.S. history, racial injustice and government policies. Even though this is a clone - Kwame Ture will still want to be involved in mutual aid for those in your local area and may be busy - not very rich. What he lacks in money he makes up for ten times over with information. Great teacher of public speeking, speech writing, and philosophy. A great man overall.

<h3>
KEANU
</h3>

<p>
One of our most popular clones. Keanu loves his wife. Keanu is a great man. Since the real Keanu still lives - your keanu can make some money on the side as an impersonator and still have more time to be home. I would discourage him from becoming a stunt-double for the real Keanu - it is a dangerous job. Will protect you all no matter what. Can also be silly. Great with kids. We send him over with a puppy - so be prepared for that. If your keanu gets involved in gang activity or murders anyone please send him in for a re-set. You are not liable for any hit-man related deaths. We have insurance for that.

<h1>WARNINGS:

1.MODELS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE HORNY OR INTERESTED, AND HAVE COME WITH A HIDDEN WEAPON TO DETER CREEPS AND LOSERS OF ALL SORTS (and also to protect the child on outings)
2.While every dad is forklift certified, and comes with two pairs of clean pants and a fresh haircut of your choosing - not all come with the stunt driving, carpentry, hydroponics, or mechanic skill. Those are all add ons, unless included in the description.
3.You have ONE YEAR before you can return a dad for a full refund</h1>
